## System Architecture

> High-level diagram showing how the different components of the system will interact with each other

![System Architecture - High-level diagram](docs/system-architecture.drawio.svg?raw=true "System Architecture - High-level diagram")

Arrows between the components indicate the direction of communication. For instance, both clients send requests to the server and receive responses from it. The server, in turn, communicates with the databases to fetch, update, or delete data as per the client's requests.

This diagram provides a high-level overview of how these components interact within the system.

The system architecture is primarily divided into four parts: the mobile client, the web client, the server and databases.

### Mobile Client

There are two mobile clients represented in the diagram, both using React Native for their frontend:

- **Mobile Client 1 (React Native)**: This client communicates with the server using GraphQL and WebSockets. The client sends requests to the server and receives responses.
- **Mobile Client 2 (React Native)**: This client also communicates with the server using GraphQL and WebSockets.

### Web Client

There is one web client represented in the diagram, using Next.js for their frontend:

- **Web Client (Next.js)**: This client doesn't communicate with any other component in the system. It's used mostly for a landing page.

### Server

Server utilizes Rust and Axum. It communicates with both mobile clients using GraphQL and WebSockets. It also interacts with the PostgreSQL database and the Redis Store.

### Databases

There are two databases in the system:

- **PostgreSQL Database**: This is a relational database used for storing structured data.
- **Redis Store**: This is an in-memory data structure store, used as a session store and message broker.
